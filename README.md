# shiny-hunt-simulator
A desktop app you can use to simulate a regular shiny hunt. Choose the pokemon you want to hunt, set your desired odds (or leave this blank, default odds are the full odds for the game the pokemon was released in), set how long each encounter should take, and click the button to generate an encounter. Made with pokeAPI v2

also, disclaimer, i am very much still learning. I just thought it was weird something like this didnt exist in this way so I just threw something together.
If you have any suggestions leave them somewhere, probably in issues or something.
